# TODO list

- Denote symlinks

- Automatically collapse:
  - hidden dirs starting with "."
  - language folders like en/ fr/ cs/ etc that all have the same files
  - somehow anything that has a uuid?
  - add command line options to disable these

- Improve performance
- Improve inputted path recognition on windows (ex C:\)
- Let the program exit gracefully on encountering permission errors
- Give performance times after searching
