# TODO list

- Automatically collapse dirs starting with "."

- fix the search ending at random files such as Config.Msi/

- Improve performance
- Write an install script
- Improve inputted path recognition on windows (ex C:\)
- Let the program exit gracefully on encountering permission errors
- Give performance times after searching
- Multi-threading
- Support command line arguments for depth and such
- add previews of text files
- show file count while counting

- add compact mode that just shows file count so it's easier to understand the file structure
